IHWAP Diagnostics: Privacy policy

Welcome to the IHWAP Diagnostics app!

This app was developed by Travis Jenkins for the University of Illinois. The app is available on the Apple App Store and Google Play.

I take privacy very seriously. I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data, created by you, is stored in-memory on your device only, and can be simply erased by fully closing the app or backing out to the initial landing page.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protects your privacy, please send me an email and I will fix it/help you.

Sincerely,

-Travis Jenkins
